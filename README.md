# EDA-Project-on-Healthcare-Dataset

This is a team project focused on performing a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a healthcare dataset under the guidance of **[The RD Group of Industry](https://github.com/TheRDGroupOfIndustries)**.  
The project aims to analyze key healthcare metrics and uncover patterns related to billing, patient demographics, and medical insights.

### 🔹 Data Cleaning Phase  
The data cleaning process was led by **[Nandini](https://github.com/nandiniarjun03)**.  
You can explore all the data cleaning-related files here:  
👉 [`/data_cleaning/`](EDA-Project-on-Healthcare-Dataset/data_cleaning/)

Detailed data cleaning steps are documented in this report:  
📄 [`ISSUE_RESOLUTION_REPORT.md`](EDA-Project-on-Healthcare-Dataset/data_cleaning/ISSUE_RESOLUTION_REPORT.md)

**Overview of Cleaning Process:**
- Handled missing values and duplicate records  
- Adjusted data types (object, numeric, and datetime)  
- Corrected mis-typed or inconsistent entries  
- Ensured data validity before EDA  

Cleaned dataset is available here:
